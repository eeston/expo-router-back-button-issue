When using `headerBackButtonDisplayMode: "minimal"` along with `headerLargeTitle: true`, the back button jumps across the screen.

This project was created using `npx create-expo-app@latest` and all that's really changed was the removal of the tabs, adding a second screen, and adding the screen settings noted above.

# Steps
- Clone/install/start project
- Click on "Press Me"
- Observe back button jump around the screen.
